This is an infinite srolling enabled app where you can search for books names. For API I used [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org). The app is hosted at vercel. [`Live Demo`](https://infinite-scrolling-next-js.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
